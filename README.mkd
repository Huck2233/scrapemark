Scrapemark
==========

Scrapemark is a super-convenient way to
[scrape webpages](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping)
in Python.

It utilizes an HTML-like markup language to extract the data you need.
You get your results as plain old Python lists and dictionaries.
Scrapemark internally utilizes [regular expressions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression)
and is super-fast.
